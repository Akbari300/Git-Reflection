when would you use a remote directory rather than keeping all your file local?
remote directory help to share file with other fellows, so they can see and contribute to the file.


why you might always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?
doing or being mmanually help to update whatever need it and when the changes has been made and ready to pull. otherwise you might working on somthing and github update automatically the directory which generally effect and satisfy the local things.
